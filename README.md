# AmpereChain Blockchain - DQBFT Implementation

This repository contains code modifications to implement DQBFT (Dynamic Quorum-Based Consensus) atop Besu for the AmpereChain blockchain network.

## Description

This implementation aims to enhance the existing blockchain network by introducing DQBFT consensus. DQBFT is a variant of QBFT (Quorum-Based Fault Tolerance) that adapts dynamically to varying network conditions, ensuring efficient consensus in a decentralized environment.

## Features

- **Dynamic Quorum Adaptation**: The consensus adapts its quorum size dynamically based on network conditions and node behavior.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Resilient to Byzantine faults within the network.
- **Efficient Consensus**: Ensures quicker consensus without compromising security.

## Installation

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amperechain/Blockchain.git
